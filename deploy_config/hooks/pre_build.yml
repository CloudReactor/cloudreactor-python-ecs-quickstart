# If your code needs to be compiled, you can add steps here to compile it,
# for example:
# name: Package code using maven
# command: "mvn package"
# tags:
#  - build
#
# After it is compiled, your Dockerfile should COPY the binary (JAR file in
# the case of JDK projects).

- name: Ensures docker_context/build dir exists
  file: path=docker_context/build state=directory
  
- name: Copy runtime .env file read by application
  copy: |
    src=deploy_config/files/.env.{{env}}
    dest=docker_context/build/.env
  tags:
