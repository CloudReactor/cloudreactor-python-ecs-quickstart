# Example deploy.env file.
#
# Rename this file "deploy.env", then fill in the secrets (either manually
# or with a script, that for example, assumes a role and gets temporary credentials).
#
# The environment variables in docker_deploy.env are used in all deployment environments.
# If your secrets vary depending on the deployment environment, you may also rename this
# "docker_deploy.<environment>.env", where <environment> is the name of your deployment environment.

# To prevent secrets from being committed into your repository, we recommend
# you can use git-encrypt to encrypt "deploy.env" and/or
# "deploy.<environment>.env".
